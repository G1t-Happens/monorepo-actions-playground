# monorepo-actions-playground

This is a test monorepo containing two separate folders — `frontend` and `backend` — created to experiment with automated versioning and release workflows using GitHub Actions.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

- To simulate a real-world monorepo structure
- To test GitHub Actions for:
    - Automatic tagging and versioning
    - Generating changelogs and release notes
    - Publishing releases based on Git tags
- To evaluate how different workflows behave in a monorepo setup
